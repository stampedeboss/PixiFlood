CURRENT VERSION 3.0

Version 3:
 is focused on delivering a single board designed to support any wattage of LED from 10w to 100w.
This objective required the design to no longer include direct attachment of the LED to the PCB, it is to 
be connected via wires to allow for the wide arrangement of LED sizes and pin spacings.

The previous design relied on non-switching voltage regulators since the voltage was limited to 12 being 
reduced to 5v.  With the use of higher wattage LED, voltage requirements are much greater required changing
the 5v voltage regulator circuitry to a switching model to eliminate the overheating of the previous design.

The PT4115 specifications are unacceptable to anything above a 20w LED, as such beginning with 3.0 the LED
Driver is being switched out for an AL8862 and the supporting components have been modified to support that
new IC.

This new design includes the addition of a sidecar that contains ESPixelStick capabilities.  Using the sidecar
and an ESP-01 the floodlight can be driven wirelessly.
