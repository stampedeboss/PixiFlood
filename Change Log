Change Log:

This version changes are based on Feedback from the community and observations from me to make it easier to test and troubleshoot.

There are no changes to the components or schematic.  This version was a reorganization of the components on board to allow for easier assembly and test.

Changes:

o  New shape and Wider Pads on the PT4115
o  12V Test Point was moved out into the open to make testing easier
o  DIM and Data Test Points were moved out into the open by spacing out the transistors to make room.
o  .1uf capacitor was moved and slightly rotated to ensure it had good spacing between it and the nearest solder point.
o  4.7K resistors were spread out to help ensure there are no solder bridges between the adjacent
