CURRENT VERSION 3.2

Version 3:
 is focused on delivering a single board designed to support any wattage of LED from 10w to 100w.
This objective required the design to no longer include direct attachment of the LED to the PCB, it is to 
be connected via wires to allow for the wide arrangement of LED sizes and pin spacings.

The previous design relied on non-switching voltage regulators since the voltage was limited to 12 being 
reduced to 5v.  With the use of higher wattage LED, voltage requirements are much greater required changing
the 5v voltage regulator circuitry to a switching model to eliminate the overheating of the previous design.

The PT4115 specifications are unacceptable to anything above a 20w LED, as such beginning with 3.0 the LED
Driver is being switched out for an AL8862 and the supporting components have been modified to support that
new IC.

This new design includes the addition of a sidecar that contains ESPixelStick capabilities.  Using the sidecar
and an ESP-01 the floodlight can be driven wirelessly.

Changes:

3.1:
    o   Reworking sidecar attachment and approach.


3.2:
    o   Reworking sidecar attachment and approach.

3.3:
    o   Prior version 3 designs used a hex inverter for signal iversion for the WS2811 IC, Beginning with 3.3, 3 transistors are now used.

    o   An error in the line driver OE connection was corrected in 3.3 eliminating the overheating and lack of signal out of the DO circuit.

    o   The sidecar was streamlines and reduced to the minimal components required to support the ESP-01 and no longer supplies programming
        circuitry. I determined it would be unlikely that the floodlight board would be moved near a computer to support
        programming via a USB. This change eliminated a number of components reducing the size and cost of the sidecar board.

    o   A seperate stand-a-lone board has been developed that can be used to program the ESP-01 modules with the ESPixelStick Firmware
        regardless of the intended platform.  This new board is a fully self contained unit that includes all circuitry including USB 
        Connector for programming.  This new board can be found in github as "stampedeboss/ESP_PGMR". This design eliminates the 
        additional wiring associated with attaching the ESPixelStick to the communications card.
