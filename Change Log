Change Log:
CURRENT VERSION 2.2

This version changes are based on my desire to have a wireless flood.  This version lays the groundwork for incorporating the hardware components found on a ESPixelStick.  

Changes:

2.0:
    o  Inital Version of the board
    
2.1:
    o   Board increased in size to allow for additional components
    o   Placement of components found in 1.1 of PixelSticks

2.2:
    o Reworking Layout
