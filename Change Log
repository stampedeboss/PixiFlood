Change Log:
VERSION 10

This version changes are based on my desire to incorporate both SMT and PTH on the same PCB

There are no changes to the schematic outside of package changes.

Changes:

o  New Inductor package was introduced that would support both SMD and the existing PTH inductors.

o  A new version for SMT only components is being developed at this time as well.  The 2N3904 has been replaced with a SMD transistor.
o  Working on replacing the Resistors with SMD 805 versions.
