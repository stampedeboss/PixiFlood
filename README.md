PixiFlood LED Driver, Turn a 10w-100w floodlight Housing into a WS2811 Floodlight Pixel

DESCRIPTION
A LED Driver that will allow a flood light to be controlled as a WS2811 Pixel. Allows up to 
170 flood lights to be controlled with a single universe. 

My goal was to enable placement of a flood light without having to deal with different controllers or 
wiring needs. By using WS2811, place a flood light at the beginning or end of a pixel string and maintain 
complete control.
